This directory contains the model and results for the "iter-gYBG model"---i.e., a model that reproduces the 1-D distribution functions along each CG dof, including intramolecular---parametrized at 300k

Prod_run_fix-box/ - production run with Gromacs (trajectory removed). Contains run files, e.g., topology, table files, etc

Analysis/

T-300k/ - comparison of various models at 300K. iter-gYBG==FM_full_3_iter-7


Vary_T/ - Temperature dependence of distributions
